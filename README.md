ID Card Processing Script
Overview
This Python script processes images of ID cards, extracting information such as name and address using the Tesseract OCR engine. The script includes image preprocessing techniques and uses the OpenCV and pytesseract libraries for image manipulation and text extraction.

Prerequisites
Before using the script, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.x recommended)
OpenCV library
pytesseract library
Tesseract OCR executable
Ensure that the Tesseract OCR executable path is correctly set in the script (tesseract_path variable).

Installation
You can install the required Python libraries using the following:
pip install opencv-python pytesseract matplotlib pandas
Make sure to install Tesseract OCR and set the path accordingly.

python script_name.py


Enter the path to the ID card image when prompted.

The script will process the image, extract relevant information, display processed images, and output the results as a DataFrame.


File Structure
script_name.py: The main Python script.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
example_id_card.jpg: Example ID card image for testing.
Additional Notes
The script assumes that the ID card image is in JPEG format. Adjust the file extension check accordingly if working with different formats.
Customize the script to handle additional fields or improve text extraction based on specific ID card formats.
